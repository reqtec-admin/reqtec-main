# 2025 Year in Review

## Commit250 App Development
REQtec advanced Commit250 from concept into a mature, market-ready product with strong user experience foundations, dependable data flows, and a scalable engagement system. The year’s work focused on deliverability, retention, and launch‑readiness with measurable progress across core product pillars.

- **User Experience & Profiles**: Progress tracking enhancements, guided onboarding resets, and richer profile data for stronger personalization.
- **Notification Engine**: Full recurring/one‑time scheduling, sound support, persistence, and edge‑case coverage.
- **Data Integrity & QA**: Multi‑week verification, beta readiness checks, and prep‑week integration stability.
- **Platform Hardening**: Critical fixes for email flows, device‑specific UI, and subscription reliability.
- **Go‑to‑Market Assets**: Holiday campaigns, onboarding messaging, and partner‑ready collateral.

Momentum peaked in late 2025, positioning Commit250 for rapid rollout with a mature feature set and well‑tested operational workflows.

## 2026 Product Focus
Areas of continued investment for Commit250 in 2026:

- Finalize remaining stability refinements for key platform workflows.
- Complete cross‑device compatibility improvements and edge‑case testing.
- Expand follow‑up loops to maximize retention and onboarding conversion.
- Advance prep‑week and evolution integrations to full production maturity.

## REQtec Business Operations
REQtec strengthened the operating foundation required for scale, partner engagement, and long‑term brand durability. The focus was on infrastructure, compliance, and market presence.

- **Digital Presence**: Updated brand narrative, new service pages, and improved conversion paths.
- **Finance & Risk**: Insurance coverage, tax planning, and banking improvements aligned with growth.
- **Partnership Pipeline**: Strategic proposals, demos, and reseller exploration.
- **Legal & Compliance**: IP protection, confidentiality frameworks, and hardened communications.
- **Market Setup**: Social and professional footprint development for future campaigns.

Execution was steady throughout the year, with a strong Q4 acceleration in partnership and infrastructure readiness.

## 2026 Business Focus
Priority initiatives for REQtec in 2026:

- Expand Commit250 content and investor‑ready materials on reqtec.com.
- Enhance scheduling and meeting workflows to improve sales velocity.
- Broaden partner and affiliate programs to scale distribution.
- Prepare investor communications, hiring pipelines, and internal operations.
- Continue partnership outreach with a focus on signed commitments.

## Financials

- **Cash on Hand**: Current cash on hand is $1107.49.
- **Reinvestment**: 2025 spending was a strategic reinvestment of $7319 into product, infrastructure, and launch readiness — entirely covered by REQtec leadership with zero impact to investors or board members.
- **Cashflow**: Summer consulting delivered strong positive cashflow, validating revenue capacity ahead of scale.

## Opportunities

- **Automated Promotion**: Expand visual content pipelines and automation to scale reach efficiently. Commit250 promotion remains the proving ground for a repeatable, automated workflow that can be transferred to REQtec’s broader portfolio (STARTYR). Priority steps include template libraries, scheduled content cadences, and measurable funnel attribution to increase conversion efficiency without increasing headcount.
- **Partner Activation**: Convert warm partner interest into committed distribution channels with measurable customer flow. Prior outreach validated demand, but commitments need to be formalized to unlock scale. Focus shifts to signed partnerships, co‑branded campaigns, and clear revenue‑share structures to ensure consistent activation.
- **Paid Acquisition**: Double‑down on the most cost‑effective channels and refine targeting. Prior tests showed Google Ads outperforming other platforms; underperforming channels will be re‑tested with tighter creative control and clearer conversion goals. The objective is a predictable CAC band that can scale alongside retention improvements.
- **Partnership Promotion**: Build structured partner offers so affiliates and clinics can reliably include Commit250 in their service stack, with incentives aligned to retention. This includes standardized onboarding kits, partner dashboards, and patient/member referral workflows that can be replicated across verticals.
- **Legal Efficiency**: Lower external legal spend through in‑house readiness and vetted providers. Prior trademark work highlighted the need for tighter vendor controls and clearer scopes. Future engagements will prioritize fixed‑fee structures, internal templates, and pre‑reviewed counsel to protect margins.
- **Consulting Leverage**: Continue high‑margin consulting as a near‑term growth engine, while reinvesting those gains into product scale and market expansion. Consulting relationships also serve as enterprise‑grade validation for REQtec’s expertise, strengthening credibility in investor conversations.

## Proposals

### Synergy Integrative (sih.reqtec.com)
An integrative health platform that elevates both practitioners and clients with a structured six‑month delivery plan. The program features bi‑weekly stakeholder syncs and monthly release windows, plus a compliance‑first roadmap (HIPAA/SOC 2) from day one. The proposal includes a practitioner console experience, a product plan, and a roadmap that sequences discovery, architecture setup, and core mobile experience for patient engagement.

### Enthous.IO (enthous.reqtec.com)
A financial ML research platform designed to validate and scale trading strategies within a secure R&D environment. Enthous.IO delivers a 12‑week phased program backed by secure data handling (10TB+), zero‑trust access controls, and reproducible pipelines for model calibration. The proposal outlines enterprise‑grade infrastructure, a three‑sprint roadmap, and evidence‑driven deliverables to de‑risk production deployment.

## Overall Summary

REQtec delivered a high‑velocity year across product execution and business infrastructure. Commit250 matured into a launch‑ready platform, while the company’s operational stack was strengthened for scale, compliance, and partner growth.

Product emphasis centered on retention, automation, and reliability; business emphasis centered on positioning, legal readiness, and capital‑efficient operations. The combination puts REQtec in a strong position for investor‑backed expansion in 2026.

REQtec also built deep cross‑platform delivery muscle with Expo and EAS, compressing time‑to‑market and lowering future development risk. With the institutional barriers to app launch removed, REQtec can now execute product releases with speed and confidence.
