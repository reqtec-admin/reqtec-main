# 2026 Strategic Plan

As we move deeper into 2026, REQtec continues our commitment to delivering straightforward, high-impact technology that helps small and medium-sized businesses stay competitive in a fast-shifting landscape. Last year demonstrated the value of focused partnerships and incubated projects that tackle everyday challenges head-on. For 2026, we're doubling down on agentic solutions—autonomous systems that plan, decide, and execute tasks with little ongoing input—prioritizing practicality over hype. These tools enable SMBs to automate complex workflows efficiently, cut costs, and break free from restrictive vendor dependencies, all while leveraging the ongoing drop in computing expenses and the rise of diversified options.

## Building on 2025 Momentum: Proven Support for SMB Resilience

Our 2025 efforts, as outlined in prior reviews, centered on real-world utility. The partnership with FinML to develop Enthous.io stands out: this independent, secure R&D platform gives small traders and fintech teams a compliant space for building predictive models, free from major cloud providers' constraints. It will accelerate iteration, ensures data privacy under GDPR, and supports collaboration—directly helping smaller players compete without massive overhead.

While we are very proud of getting [Commit 250](https://commit250.com) out the door, we are most excited about our [incubated projects](https://reqtec.com/our-work):

- **Synergy Integrative** unifies scheduling, secure data exchange, and administrative tasks in healthcare, reducing burdens for practitioners and improving patient outcomes.
- **DEALVR** optimizes local delivery networks with automated inventory, routing, and tracking, allowing SMB merchants to rival big logistics firms.
- **HANNO** provides migration playbooks and risk assessments to guide businesses away from dominant tech stacks toward sovereign alternatives.
- **STARTYR** offers an integrated ecosystem of alternative tools, with managed support and automation for maintenance, easing the shift to lower-cost, ethical infrastructure.
- [**Enthous.io**](https://enthous.reqtec.com) further extend this by automating habit tracking in wellness and model experimentation in finance, respectively.
- **Nimble** Too Be Announced Soon (you are going to like it).

These initiatives addressed volatility—supply disruptions, rising costs, compliance pressures—by giving SMBs agile, in-house capabilities that larger competitors often struggle to replicate quickly due to their scale and legacy systems.

## 2026 Focus: Agentic Solutions Inspired by Rapid Innovation

The [tech realignment](https://www.reqtec.com/posts/tech-realignment) of early 2026 exposed vulnerabilities in centralized giants: massive AI spending led to market corrections, with trillions in value erased as investors questioned unsustainable models. This shift favors nimble operations, where agentic systems automate workflows end-to-end, from supply chain adjustments to financial auditing and customer routing. As computing costs continue to plummet—thanks to open-source models and broader hardware access—SMBs can access powerful automation at fractions of prior prices, often 40-50% lower than proprietary alternatives.

We're inspired by community-driven advancements in agentic automation, particularly developments around tools like n8n. Recent examples highlight how quickly sophisticated agents emerge: one notable case, Agent One, built in just days using n8n combined with advanced models, demonstrates autonomy with built-in security. It outperforms earlier concepts by enabling rapid prototyping of secure, decision-making workflows—perfect for SMBs needing reliable execution without extensive coding.

Drawing from this spirit, our agentic offerings emphasize modular, interoperable frameworks that SMBs can adapt to their needs. These solutions handle proactive tasks—monitoring market changes, optimizing inventory in real time, or routing support queries—while integrating seamlessly across diverse systems. No single tool dominates; instead, we promote flexible setups that evolve with the business.

Central to reducing lock-in are translation layers: intelligent bridges that convert data formats, APIs, and workflows between platforms effortlessly. What might take a year of engineering work to migrate away from a vendor now takes weeks. We are digging in here as this seems to be a tremendous opportunity area. An SMB tied to an expensive cloud setup can transition to cost-effective alternatives in weeks, maintaining operations without major rewrites. This extends to software, hardware, and networking, creating a fluid ecosystem where switching vendors doesn't mean starting over. Diversification becomes the norm, not the exception, as open models and community tools democratize access and erode oligarchic control.

In 2026, we'll expand consulting to include agentic assessments: identifying high-impact automation opportunities, deploying tailored agents (e.g., for predictive patient scheduling in healthcare or automated ledger reconciliation in finance), and supporting migrations via HANNO and STARTYR. These practical deployments help SMBs outpace slower giants burdened by bureaucracy, turning economic uncertainty into an advantage through efficiency and independence.

## Looking Ahead: Sustainable Competitiveness for SMBs

REQtec's 2026 plan is grounded in reality: agentic automation isn't about replacing people but optimizing their time with tools that handle routine complexity, freeing focus for growth. With costs dropping and options multiplying, the future favors businesses that embrace diversification and autonomy.

If you're an SMB ready to implement agentic workflows that deliver measurable results—while minimizing dependencies—let's connect. Together, we can build a tech foundation that's resilient, affordable, and fully under your control.
