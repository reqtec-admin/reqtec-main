# What Radicalized Us

## A Refuge Lost

Working in a tech firm located in one of the most conservative regions of the United States once felt like a genuine escape from the ideological battles that defined coastal tech hubs. The focus was practical: building software solutions for local industries such as agriculture and manufacturing, solving real problems with code, and advancing based on results rather than politics. Yet even in this heartland setting, far removed from Silicon Valley’s echo chambers, the tech industry’s dominant progressive culture proved impossible to avoid. Over time the workplace became an environment where holding non-left beliefs turned into a serious professional liability—risking exclusion, ostracism, or outright career damage.

## The Catalyst and Its Aftermath

The turning point arrived with the national response to George Floyd’s death in May 2020. His passing was sad—a life lost during an arrest—but the real catastrophe unfolded in the weeks and months that followed. Riots and widespread destruction, often amplified by leftist agitators and opportunistic groups, inflicted devastating economic harm. Insured losses from arson, looting, and vandalism exceeded $1–2 billion, marking the costliest civil unrest in modern U.S. history. In Minneapolis–Saint Paul alone, more than 1,500 properties suffered damage, with losses approaching $500 million. Small and minority-owned businesses—barbecue joints, record stores, clothing shops—were hit hardest, many never reopening. The economic fallout lingered for years, depressing property values and investment in already struggling neighborhoods.

## Mandatory Racial Reckoning

Inside the firm, however, the overwhelming focus was not on the destruction of businesses or the broader societal damage. Instead, leadership and HR launched an immediate, intense, and unrelenting campaign of mandatory race-related training and discussions. Starting almost immediately after the incident and continuing for months, every employee—regardless of role, background, or personal connection to the events—was required to participate in a barrage of DEI sessions, “anti-racism” workshops, white-privilege seminars, microaggression trainings, and safe-space guidance.

These were not optional or lightly scheduled. They consumed entire workdays, pulling developers, engineers, project managers, and support staff away from client deadlines and deliverables. Zoom calls stretched for hours; reading lists heavy on progressive authors were distributed company-wide; group discussions demanded public reflection on personal “complicity” in systemic racism. The central message was unyielding: whiteness itself constituted a problem that needed constant examination and atonement. Employees who had no involvement in policing, no ties to Minneapolis, and no role in any of the events were nevertheless instructed to interrogate their own racial identity, acknowledge inherent biases, and commit to ongoing “anti-racist” practice.

The absurdity was palpable. People who spent their days writing code, debugging systems, or supporting customers in flyover country were suddenly subjected to sessions that treated them as though they bore collective responsibility for a single incident hundreds of miles away. Dissent was not tolerated. Raising questions about the relevance of these trainings to software development, pointing out the destruction caused by the riots, or expressing any discomfort with being repeatedly labeled as oppressors based solely on skin color invited immediate pushback. HR framed disagreement as evidence of defensiveness or fragility, while leadership insisted participation was non-negotiable to maintain “inclusivity” and align with industry norms.

## Vaccine Mandates and Surveillance Culture

The pressure did not stop at racial ideology. The COVID-19 vaccine rollout layered new forms of coercion and exclusion on top of the existing environment. Despite operating almost entirely remotely via Zoom, vaccine status became a hard requirement for certain client contracts, especially those involving government or large enterprise customers. Team members with documented natural immunity from prior infections were still barred from those projects and excluded from company-sponsored retreats and team events. Some HR staff who had personally experienced vaccine-related side effects continued pushing boosters with evangelical intensity. Cloth masks were treated as essential even during rare in-office interactions; appearing without one caused colleagues to scatter down hallways as though contagion were imminent.

Most invasively, employees were compelled to declare their vaccination status in internal company systems, overriding any prior expectation of medical privacy. A recent Stanford graduate took it upon himself to patrol office corridors, directly asking people about their status and insisting they get vaccinated immediately.

## Disturbing Peer Conversations

These personal conversations with peers were startling, revealing a deeper embrace of overreach within the team. One peer casually described working on an R&D proposal to deploy infrared cameras on drones to scan crowds for individuals with elevated body temperatures, potentially indicating COVID-19 or other fevers. He showed no concern for privacy implications or the broader governmental overreach this could enable—treating it as a straightforward tech innovation without ethical qualms.

Another colleague was excitedly contributing to an open-source project developing a "Health Pass" app, which would track users' current booster counts to grant or deny access to social events, workplaces, and public spaces. Having studied history, I was immediately unnerved by the parallels to the Gesundheitspass from the Nazi Germany era, used to isolate those deemed "unhealthy" under the regime's control. Yet these ideas were discussed with enthusiasm, as if such surveillance tools were benign progress rather than echoes of authoritarian control.

The cumulative atmosphere shifted from collaborative to constantly surveilled. Any viewpoint that deviated from the approved narrative—whether about race trainings, vaccine policy, mask rules, or the scale of riot damage—was treated as a threat to team harmony.

## Industry-Wide Groupthink

This was not an isolated phenomenon. Across the tech sector during this period, leftist groupthink became the default operating system. Young, highly educated workforces skewed progressive by demographic default. Talent pipelines from elite universities imported social-justice frameworks into every corner of the industry. Remote work erased geographic distance, allowing coastal cultural norms to flood even conservative regions. Company leadership, anxious about reputational risk and lost business, adopted DEI mandates, pronoun policies, and political conformity tests wholesale. Conservative or even moderate employees learned quickly to self-censor. Expressing concern about forced racial trainings, questioning aspects of vaccine mandates, or challenging the framing of whiteness as inherently problematic invited social isolation, lowered performance reviews, or termination.

## The Cost of Non-Conformity

The result was unmistakable: thriving in tech while holding non-left beliefs became extraordinarily difficult. Energy once devoted to technical innovation was redirected toward navigating ideological expectations and avoiding perceived missteps. Genuine diversity of thought evaporated, replaced by enforced consensus. Many talented contributors quietly left for smaller startups, freelance work, or entirely different industries. The firm itself lost momentum as skilled people refused to conform.

## A Sobering Lesson

Looking back, those years revealed a sobering reality. The tech industry’s original promise—meritocracy, freedom to innovate, escape from rigid hierarchies—had been hollowed out by ideological uniformity. Even in the most conservative parts of the country, the machinery of progressive enforcement—DEI bureaucracies, client pressure, university influence, and social-media amplification—proved relentless. For anyone who valued evidence-based reasoning, individual liberty, and authentic viewpoint diversity, the message was clear: conform, stay silent, or leave.

The experience remains a stark cautionary tale. An industry built on disruption and open inquiry had become one of the most powerful enforcers of a narrow ideological orthodoxy. True diversity, especially of thought, was sacrificed in the name of inclusion—leaving those who refused to participate in the mandatory racial reckoning with nowhere to hide.
