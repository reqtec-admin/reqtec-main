# 2025 Year in Review

## Commit250 App Development
Major progress on the Commit250 fitness/evolution app, including user experience enhancements, bug resolutions, notifications/reminders, data handling, and marketing/outreach campaigns. Key categories of completions:

- **User Profile and Experience Features**: Support for before/after pictures in profiles; info icon/modal for reopening intro content on prep weeks; ease of creating progress and evolution tasks; user profile storage for fitness metrics.
- **Notifications and Reminders System**: Full implementation including sound support, modal for setting times/days, recurring/one-time options, storage/clearing on completion/reset/fast-forward/rewind, edge cases, and UI icons/badges.
- **Data and Testing**: Verification of data integrity across multiple prep weeks and evolutions; test-pre-launch/beta checks; integration of prep week tasks and subtasks.
- **Bug Fixes**: Grace period expiration handling (iOS/Android/Apple links, Samsung share progress, prep week 1 reset, email issues); truncated lists on Samsung Galaxy; iOS subscription email errors; other testing-reported issues.
- **Marketing and User Outreach**: Holiday-themed emails (Vets Day, Thanksgiving); Commit 250 intro email for SIH; SIH postcard ordering; SynergyApp product plan draft; Google Play tester followup.
- **Other App/Prep Work**: Multiple prep week and evolution task updates; edge function directory cleanup.

Many tasks completed in November 2025 (e.g., 11/25 cluster for SIH/emails, 11/08 for testing/followups, 11/06-11/03 for profiles/reminders/bugs). Earlier 2025 work supported pre-launch stability and iterations.

### 2026 Planned Tasks 
Pending resolution or continuation into 2026 (primarily bug fixes and platform-specific issues still in To Do / Doing):
- Ongoing bug investigations and fixes, including:
  - Link functionality in Grace Period Expiring emails (cross-platform: iOS, Android, browser; no clickable link detected)
  - Share Progress feature issues on Samsung devices
- Additional platform testing and compatibility refinements (e.g., Samsung Galaxy list display, iOS-specific behaviors)
- Potential follow-up on pre-launch / beta testing feedback loops
- Any remaining prep week / evolution integration tweaks not yet moved to Done

## REQtec Business Operations

Business infrastructure, outreach, and administrative tasks advanced significantly, supporting scalability and partnerships. Key categories of completions:

- **Website and Digital Presence**: Multiple updates including "Why REQtec" content (value proposition, cancellation resilience, anti-Big Tech messaging); calendar for scheduling meetings; additions of C250, Enthous.IO, Nebula, and SIH pages/links; overall site builds and refinements (early-mid 2025 focus).
- **Financial and Banking**: Old Glory Bank account application/inquiry (Dec 2025, noting conservative alignment); tax planning and gathering deductions (Nov 2025); E&O insurance; expense moves (e.g., off FNBO); app store business account opening (May 2025).
- **Partnerships and Outreach**: FinML proposal/project plan and calls (late 2025); Advanced Hosting demo; calls/contacts (Jane Little, Joe M, law firms); GitLab setup on Hetzner; potential affiliate/reseller notes.
- **Legal and Compliance**: Email confidentiality/disclaimer language; trademarked materials and NDA/contract to law firm; professional email setup (now fully on Proton); domain moves and management (now entirely Cloudflare).
- **Social and Setup**: Starter accounts on X/LinkedIn (Facebook pending); REQtec info to law firms; prep for code exams; social media planning elements.

A high number of tasks were completed throughout the year, with website/financial/legal in Q1-Q2, insurance/setup in mid-year (Aug), and banking/website refinements/partnership inquiries peaking in Nov-Dec 2025.

### 2026 Planned Tasks
Pending items:
- Website refinements and additions, including:
  - Integration / expansion of Commit250-related content on reqtec.com
  - Calendar / scheduling enhancements for meetings
  - Potential further partner / affiliate page updates
  - Investors Notice
  - Hiring / Careers
  - CMS Implementation
- Ongoing partnership outreach follow-ups

### Overall Highlights and Progress
- **Volume and Timing**: Substantial output in both boards, with Commit250 showing intense late-year pushes (app readiness/marketing) and REQtec focusing on foundational business infrastructure (website visibility, financial/legal stability, partnership probes). Many Q4 2025 completions align with year-end momentum.
- **Themes**: App side emphasized user retention (reminders, profiles, grace periods), testing/bug fixes for launch readiness, and targeted outreach (holiday/SIH emails). Business side prioritized digital presence, conservative-aligned partnerships, tax/insurance compliance, and legal protections.
- **Impact**: These completions advanced the Commit250 app toward pre-launch/beta maturity while strengthening REQtec's operational backbone (website content/SEO, banking, legal safeguards, outreach pipelines). No major outstanding blockers noted in done tasks; planned tasks above represent natural carryover into 2026 for polish, scaling, and next-phase execution.

## Opportunities for Improvement

- **Automated Promotion**: While we have created accounts on several social media platforms and have posted regularly, it is clear we need to have more tailored management with visual content. Commit250 Promotion is where it was intended to prove this out to then transfer that knowledge of automated workflows to other businesses including REQtec proper. However, this has proven time-consuming and costly to implement, though it is still feasible.

- **Partnership Promotion**: We had Synergy step forward to offer their clientele as a base of initial customers; however, that has not proven out in the numbers. We are still lacking commitment to make the Commit250 App part of their offering as a clinic. Other promotional partners also did not deliver due to time constraints and other priorities.

- **Advertisement**: Google Ads turned out to be the most cost-effective, bringing in 1 customer at $300. We did not see any engagement or subscription through X, which was not expected and disappointing. There is a high likelihood that X's algorithm is simply not as well-tuned as Google, but at 10 times the cost, we expected some interaction and subscriptions.

- **Legal Fees**: The firm AKC Law was 6 times the original expected cost. They were referred to us by Joe Mitchell (trusted partner at PIP Marketing), but they severely overcharged for 2 trademarks. Each trademark costs $700 to file with the USPTO, but hours and time back and forth with new staff at AKC racked up charges that are not in any world competitive with peers. We will not be working with AKC again. Also, we have gained enough institutional knowledge that we will not require a lawyer to file any additional trademarks or patents.

- **Consultation**: AI and software consultation to larger institutions as an individual provider seems to be the most profitable approach to income this last year.

## Financials

- **Balance**: Our current Navy Federal Business account has $1107.49. 

- **Profit/Loss**: Projections across the year show a loss of $7319. But that number needs to be reviewed as its accounting expenses that may not apply. 

- **Cashflow**: The summer months looked really good for Cash Flow while doing consulting work.
