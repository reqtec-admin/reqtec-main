# Partnership in Cutting-Edge Financial ML

**Requisite Technologies Partners with FinML to Launch Cutting-Edge R&D Platform**

At Requisite Technologies, we’ve always been about pushing boundaries and delivering innovative solutions that empower businesses to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. As a leading alt-tech technology solutions provider, we’re thrilled to announce our new partnership with FinML, a forward-thinking financial solutions firm, to create a state-of-the-art Research and Development (R&D) platform hosted on a non-woke tech cloud provider. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in our mission to provide secure, efficient, and value-driven technology solutions for the financial sector and beyond.

## Why This Partnership Matters

The financial industry is at a crossroads, with increasing demand for advanced technologies that can handle complex data, ensure regulatory compliance, and drive innovation—all while maintaining trust and transparency. FinML, known for its expertise in developing AI-driven financial solutions, shares our commitment to delivering tools that prioritize performance and integrity over fleeting trends or ideological distractions.

Together, we’re building an R&D platform that will serve as a game-changer for financial institutions, fintech startups, and enterprises looking to innovate without compromising their values. By hosting this platform on a non-woke tech cloud provider, we’re ensuring that our clients have access to a secure, scalable, and neutral environment that focuses on results—not agendas.

## What the R&D Platform Offers

Our new R&D platform is designed to accelerate innovation in the financial sector by providing a robust, flexible, and secure environment for developing and testing next-generation solutions. Here’s what makes this platform stand out:

- **AI-Powered Innovation**: Leveraging FinML’s expertise in machine learning and data analytics, the platform enables users to develop advanced financial models, predictive algorithms, and automated workflows that enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

- **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure**: Hosted on a non-woke tech cloud provider, the platform offers unparalleled scalability and security. This ensures that businesses can experiment, iterate, and deploy solutions without worrying about censorship, data privacy breaches, or platform bias.

- **Compliance and Security First**: With the financial industry facing stringent regulatory requirements, our platform is built to comply with global standards such as GDPR, Dodd-Frank, and MiFID II. Robust encryption, authentication, and audit trails ensure that your data and intellectual property remain protected.

- **Collaborative Ecosystem**: The platform fosters collaboration between developers, data scientists, and financial experts, enabling cross-functional teams to work seamlessly on projects ranging from blockchain-based payment systems to algorithmic trading solutions.

- **Cost-Effective Development**: By streamlining the R&D process and reducing reliance on legacy systems, our platform helps businesses save time and resources while accelerating time-to-market for new financial products and services.

### Why not a Cloud?

In today’s tech landscape, many cloud providers are increasingly entangled in ideological debates that can compromise their neutrality and reliability. At Requisite Technologies, we believe that technology should serve as a tool for empowerment, not a platform for enforcing specific worldviews. By partnering with a non-woke tech cloud provider, we’re offering our clients a space where innovation can flourish without external pressures or biases.

This choice reflects our commitment to providing solutions that align with the needs and values of our clients. Whether you’re a fintech startup, a credit union, or a global financial institution, you can trust that our platform prioritizes your goals—faster innovation, better security, and greater control over your data.

### What’s Next?

The R&D platform is already in development, with early access planned for select partners in Q3 2025. We’re working closely with FinML to ensure that the platform meets the highest standards of performance, security, and usability. Over the coming months, we’ll be sharing updates on key features, case studies, and opportunities for businesses to get involved.
