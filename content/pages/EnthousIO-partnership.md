# Partnership in Cutting-Edge Financial ML

## Requisite Technologies Partners with FinML to Launch Cutting-Edge R&D Platform

At Requisite Technologies, we’re committed to driving innovation and delivering solutions that empower businesses to succeed in a dynamic digital world. As a leading alt-tech technology solutions provider, we’re excited to announce our partnership with FinML, a forward-thinking financial solutions firm, to create a state-of-the-art Research and Development (R&D) platform hosted on an ethical tech cloud (avoiding BigTech). This collaboration is a bold step toward providing secure, efficient, and value-driven technology solutions for the financial sector and beyond.

### Why This Partnership Matters

The financial industry is navigating a complex landscape, with growing demand for advanced technologies that manage intricate data, ensure compliance, and foster innovation—all while maintaining trust and transparency. FinML, renowned for its AI-driven financial solutions, shares our dedication to delivering tools that prioritize performance and integrity over distractions or external pressures.

Together, we’re building an R&D platform that will redefine innovation for financial institutions, fintech startups, and enterprises seeking to create without compromise. By hosting this platform on an ethical tech cloud (avoiding BigTech), we’re ensuring clients have access to a secure, scalable, and neutral environment that focuses on results.

### What the R&D Platform Offers

Our R&D platform is designed to accelerate financial innovation by providing a robust, flexible, and secure environment for developing and testing next-generation solutions. Key features include:

- **AI-Powered Innovation**: Leveraging FinML’s expertise in machine learning and data analytics, the platform enables users to build advanced financial models, predictive algorithms, and automated workflows that enhance decision-making and efficiency.

- **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure**: Hosted on an ethical tech cloud (avoiding BigTech), the platform offers unmatched scalability and security, allowing businesses to experiment, iterate, and deploy solutions without concerns about data privacy or platform bias.

- **Compliance and Security First**: Built to meet global regulatory standards like GDPR, Dodd-Frank, and MiFID II, the platform features robust encryption, authentication, and audit trails to protect data and intellectual property.

- **Collaborative Ecosystem**: The platform supports seamless collaboration among developers, data scientists, and financial experts, enabling cross-functional teams to tackle projects from blockchain-based payments to algorithmic trading.

- **Cost-Effective Development**: By streamlining R&D processes and reducing reliance on legacy systems, the platform saves time and resources, speeding up time-to-market for new financial products and services.

### Why an Alternative Tech Approach?

In today’s tech landscape, many cloud providers are entangled in practices that can undermine neutrality and reliability. At Requisite Technologies, we believe technology should empower, not impose. By partnering with an ethical tech cloud provider (avoiding BigTech), we offer a space where innovation thrives free from external pressures or biases.

This choice reflects our commitment to aligning with our clients’ needs and values. Whether you’re a fintech startup, credit union, or global financial institution, our platform ensures faster innovation, better security, and greater control over your data.
